### Generate Documentation

All the documentation of the project are avaiable on Wiki. If you prefer the PDF version, you can generate it with the command `rake build:doc`. But before that, check if you have the requirements programs to do that.

**Requirements**
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [markdown-pdf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-pdf)
